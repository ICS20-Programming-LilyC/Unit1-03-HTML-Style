  <h2 class="country">England</h2>
  <p>The rose is the national flower of England. The rose was chosen after the civil wars that took place in the years 1455-1485. It was between the royal house of Lancaster whose emblem was a red rose and the royal house of York whose emblem was a white rose. This was why the wars were named The Wars of the Roses, which then gave England their national flower.</p>
